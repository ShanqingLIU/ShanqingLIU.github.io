Binpacking is an important combinatorial problem in operations research. Conic submodular binpacking generalizes the classical binpacking problem to nonlinear setting, and it can formulate the chance-constrained binpacking, the distributionally robust binpacking etc. cbp implements several branch-and-price algorithms to solve the conic submodular binpacking problems.

wUMCFC is written in C++ based on [SCIP](https://www.scipopt.org/). It also requires CPLEX to build.
