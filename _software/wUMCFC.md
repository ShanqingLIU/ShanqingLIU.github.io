wUMCFC is a specialized branch-and-price (BP) based solver for unsplittable multi-commodity flow routing with network coding. Unsplittable multi-commodity flow is a fundamentel problem in network optimization. wUMCFC uses network coding to decrease the routing cost and increase the capacity usage for wireless networks.

wUMCFC is written in C++ based on [SCIP](https://www.scipopt.org/). It requires CMake and C++ complier to build.

Two benchmarks are in the `data` directory.
