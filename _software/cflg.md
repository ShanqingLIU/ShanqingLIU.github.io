Facility location is an important appication in operations research. Continuous set covering on networks generalizes the classical dicrete set covering problems in graphs, which allows both the demands and facilities continuously locating in edges. cflg contains several algorithms for solving continuous set covering on networks. cflg is written in Julia based on JuMP.
