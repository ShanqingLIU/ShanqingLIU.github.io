 In urban air mobility probelm, Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOLs) vehicles are used to move passengers between vertiports. Safety landing sites (SLSs) cover the trajectory of VTOLs for emergency landings. We study the optimal placement of SLSs in UAM network under budget constraints on SLS installation.
