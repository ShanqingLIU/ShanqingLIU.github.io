Discrete Mathematics MAA 103 (Year 1) explores the world of discrete mathematics which is a fundamental concept in many different areas of science and advanced mathematics. After a short review of some basic concepts (functions, induction, cardinality) the course goes on the exploration of new topics (basic notions in number and groups theory, combinatorics, permutations). In a second part, we introduce probability theory, first on finite sets, and then on countable ones.
