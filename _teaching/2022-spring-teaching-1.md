The objective of this course is to introduce mathematical modeling to study systems evolving over time in a deterministic or random manner. The point of view adopted is to choose a few examples from different disciplinary fields (biology or ecology, physics or chemistry, economics or finance). We wish to introduce the reader to this modeling approach, which allows us to summarise and simplify a concrete problem in order to understand and analyse it mathematically. The objective is also to introduce the reader to new mathematical notions which will prove to be the fundamental tools for the study of the problem.
