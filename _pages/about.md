I am a third-year Ph.D student at [Centre de Mathématiques Appliquées (CMAP), École Polytechnique](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/fr/page-daccueil) and [INRIA, Saclay-Il-de France](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-saclay), where I am part of [TROPICAL](https://team.inria.fr/tropical/) Team. I am supervised by [Marianne Akian](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~akian/) and [Stéphane Gaubert](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~gaubert/).

I study mixed integer linear and nonlinear programming, with a special interest in convexification of nonconvex set. Currenly, I am working on the following topics: 
- Decomposition methods;
- Cutting plane methods;
- Applications in network optimization.

My research are mostly based on open-source software, and most of my codes are open-source.

## My background

I did master study in [Master in Optimization](https://www.master-in-optimization.fr/),  a joint program between [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/?lang=fr) and [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en). Priori to that, I spent 1-year at [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) as an M1 student in computer science. I obtained my bachelor degree in machine intellegence from [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/).
